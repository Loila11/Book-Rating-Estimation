      "i honestly don & # 8217 ; t know what this book was about . great title , but what old town ? i still don & # 8217 ; t know . is it glasgow , london , manchester , a little fishing village in scotland , i don & # 8217 ; t know.so many of the stories failed to reach an ending or make any sense whatsoever . you & # 8217 ; ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes , but we never find out why or what led up to it . he ends up beating a drug dealer up , tying his hands and feet together and then placing his feet through a pair of gymnast & # 8217 ; s rings ! how does he manage that when they & # 8217 ; re tied together ? and even if he untied them what would keep them there ? he & # 8217 ; d just drop to the floor.we get another fellow who & # 8217 ; s the butt of a joke at a roof party & # 8211 ; i & # 8217 ; m trying desperately not to be a & # 8216 ; spoiler & # 8217 ; here & # 8211 ; with the words , & # 8220 ; should have known who & # 8217 ; d been holding the it an & # 8217 ; all & # 8230 ; & # 8221 ; and i & # 8217 ; ve no idea what that means . anyway he takes the opportunity to attack two of his antagonists from behind and push them off the roof stating , & # 8220 ; i held onto their belts for a moment until i had to let go. & # 8221 ; what ! he held onto their belts for a moment ? assuming they weighed approximately the same as him , he & # 8217 ; s holding twice his own weight with no anchorage whatsoever . it would pull him straight off the roof too.this is another story that just stops . a crowded party , everyone would have either witnessed him do this or seen the bodies falling through the air and looked round at him . but no , the story just stops right there . it & # 8217 ; s rubbish ! too often we & # 8217 ; re left to guess at the ending . two young boys playing on a beach hear a choir , a sure sign that there & # 8217 ; s been loss of life at sea , and then their mother doesn & # 8217 ; t turn up for tea . are we supposed to assume she & # 8217 ; s dead ? she certainly wasn & # 8217 ; t lost at sea . i didn & # 8217 ; t know what to make of that story at all.then there & # 8217 ; s the story of three white lads attacking and raping muslim women . it seemed to jump about all over the place , going back in time and introducing ( i think ) six muslim men that i kind of lost track as to who was who.nigel bird seems a genuine chap , who & # 8217 ; s very serious about his writing , and i feel awful offering such a poor review , especially as he & # 8217 ; s evidently working so hard , but i have to be honest . i think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish . they have little more imagination than an average schoolboy . they start out of nowhere , in the middle of a plot , and finish abruptly when the reader knows full well there & # 8217 ; s going to be consequences for the actions taken at the end.every story is incomplete . i won & # 8217 ; t be reading anymore from this author . \n",

      "apparently i have a thing for dragons , and there aren & # 8217 ; t even any shifters in here , go figure ! i was actually pretty surprised at how much i liked the plot of maiden flight . a lot of the story was world building , character introduction , and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes . this is my first m & eacute ; nage a trios read so it & # 8217 ; s exciting to get something new under the reading belt . being a short kindle freebie i was pretty satisfied overall . i & # 8217 ; ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to anne mccaffrey & # 8217 ; s dragonriders of pern series and i can & # 8217 ; t comment on that because i haven & # 8217 ; t had the chance to start her books yet . i can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but i really don & # 8217 ; t like copycats , just saying . i hope i don & # 8217 ; t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes & # 8230 ; the storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top . the dragons are intelligent , fierce , and very loyal warriors . they are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with . but the bond doesn & # 8217 ; t stop there & # 8211 ; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first . why , might you ask ? well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels . so in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to . this exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating . if there was human sex , there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well , and vice versa . this i could handle . the insta-love on the other hand i had an issue with.i mentioned in a previous review that i used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight . it & # 8217 ; s such a dreamy and romantic idea that i still sometimes like to daydream about it . but reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment . i find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero . sadly in maiden flight & # 8217 ; s case the couple ( and the third-wheel ! ) gets hit pretty hard . now of course once i got my eyes to focus in their proper position i just accepted the fact that it was part of the story . after that i could enjoy most of what was going on . i actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine & # 8217 ; s mother and her perspective beau . it was slower-paced and much more realistic.although there wasn & # 8217 ; t much of a plot to be found i still enjoyed the book . i liked maiden flight so much that i went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses . i am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out . i & # 8217 ; m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on , the politics within the lair , and i & # 8217 ; d like to see more interaction between the characters . i like me some sex but i also like some dialogue , some intrigue , something , anything really . hopefully i & # 8217 ; ll get some of that with the upcoming books . \n",

      "warning : this review might contain what some people consider spoilers.rating : 7/10pros : - this author excels at historical works . the settings are rich and detailed , and the language is elegant and ( at least to my eyes ) contains few or no historical inaccuracies.- i loved the play back and forth between the two men : the fight for dominance as well as the easing of tension when they & # 8217 ; re alone , especially considering how properly they both behave in public.cons : - there are scenes from both characters & # 8217 ; perspectives in the story , but i wanted to see a bit * more * from arsen & # 8217 ; s point of view . i was more interested in seeing inside of the arrogant wastrel & # 8217 ; s head than the lovesick puppy & # 8217 ; s.- we don & # 8217 ; t get to see any of the men & # 8217 ; s past interactions ; we & # 8217 ; re simply told about them briefly . as a result , the love arsen feels for henry wasn & # 8217 ; t very believable for me.overall comments : i enjoyed this , but the deficiencies in character development prevented me from loving it . it & # 8217 ; s a pretty short story ( 1170 kindle locations ) , and it & # 8217 ; s at least 50 % sex . the romantic element of it felt a bit lopsided to me in that one man is obviously crazy in love and the other has a tinge of indifference about him . \n",

      "my thoughts - out of unicorns - i loved it ! ! ! * * gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewokay first things , this is a very adult erotic short story . it is only about pages , and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some m/m/f.the cover is okay and shows the characters , but it doesn & # 8217 ; t grab my attention . you definitely don & # 8217 ; t want to judge this book by its cover.okay i loved this story , but if you aren & # 8217 ; t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don & # 8217 ; t read this story . it is a quick read , but it totally had my attention . you get glimpses into the lives of the characters in this book and some background . i & # 8217 ; m not usually one for short stories , but kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.i totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves kally & # 8217 ; s work . i can & # 8217 ; t wait to read more of this series in the future . \n",

      "my soul to lose by rachel vincent , narrated by amanda ronconiprequel to the soul screamers series3.5 starskaylee cavanaugh was supposed to just have a normal day shopping at the mall , but a panic attack took over and she couldn & # 8217 ; t stop screaming . when she wakes up , she finds herself in a psych hospital . as she tries to convince everyone she is fine , another patient seems to be curious about who she is . my first audiobook ! i would say it was a success . i didn & # 8217 ; t love my soul to lose but i really enjoyed it . the narrator could be annoying at times , but she could make the story interesting when it came down to whether i was able to concentrate on the story . i did have a few problems with the narrator & # 8217 ; s voice and how she portrayed the characters . sometimes i liked the voices she made , but her kaylee voice annoyed me greatly at times . which is obviously not a good thing considering the fact that kaylee is the mc . i did enjoy the storyline and i was a fan of the first soul screamers book . i really liked seeing how vincent portrayed kaylee & # 8217 ; s first experience as a banshiede . another qualm i had was with the other patient who was revealed to have an ability at the end . i liked this ability quite a bit and she proved to be an interesting character that showed potential to be in the series in the future or even have her own . i was sad that her reveal was so rushed and it left me feeling confused and i had to rewind the audiobook a bit . i & # 8217 ; m quite pleased with my first delve into the audiobook world and i & # 8217 ; m happy it wasn & # 8217 ; t terrible like i was afraid it would be.cover thoughts : it & # 8217 ; s simple , but i don & # 8217 ; t like that snot color green at all . \n",
